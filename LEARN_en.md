## Idea
Continuing to study backend development, I started reading about gRPC. It seemed to me that this is a pretty cool and convenient protocol and, after thinking about it, I decided that I still want to implement a server on it

> Always try to implement your ideas. I tried and, perhaps, you will think that my project turned out to be good

## Implementation
Since I really liked the Rust language, I decided that this is the language I would implement my idea in. The search engine and YouTube helped me learn about ways to create a gRPC server and client.

> You will always have difficulties along the way. I encountered them when adding a database to the project

## Future
I will try to support and improve this project. Perhaps my example will help you in your projects! Good luck to you!
